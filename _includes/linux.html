    <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
      <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. LibreOffice comes
      preinstalled with several Linux distributions. If you don't already have it, use
      your package manager to install it: (e.g., <code>sudo apt-get install
	libreoffice</code> for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions).
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
  <br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs
  through a web browser, and any browser - Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer -
  should work fine.  You will need to download Google Refine and install it, and
  when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need an
  internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
	page</a>
    <li>Click on <i>Linux kit</i> to download the install file
    <li>Download and extract
    <li>Type <code>./refine</code> in your terminal and Google Refine will then
    open in your web browser.
    <li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started
      the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should
      see OpenRefine.
  </ul>
<li><b>Git</b>
<br>Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for 
  easily updating a shared or public version of your code on github.com. You will need a supported web browser 
  (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
<BR>
  You will need an account at <a href="http://github.com"  target="_blank">github.com</a> for parts of the Git lesson. 
  Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. 
<ul>
<li>Create a free GitHub account at <a href="http://github.com"  target="_blank">github.com</a> and confirm your email. If you already have
  a Github account, check to see if you remember your password and can access the account.
<li>Download and install Git for your operating system: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
