get help.

<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Mac
should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version x.y.z</b>. You
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically.
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
<br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
You will need to download Google Refine and install it,
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
<ul>
<li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
page</a>
<li>Click on <i>Mac kit</i> to download the install file
<li>Open the downloaded .dmg file
<li>Drag the icon in to the Applications folder
<li>Double click on the icon and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
<li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
</ul>
<li><b>Git</b>
<br>Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for 
  easily updating a shared or public version of your code on github.com. You will need a supported web browser 
  (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
<BR>
  You will need an account at <a href="http://github.com"  target="_blank">github.com</a> for parts of the Git lesson. 
  Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. 
<ul>
<li>Create a free GitHub account at <a href="http://github.com"  target="_blank">github.com</a> and confirm your email. If you already have
  a Github account, check to see if you remember your password and can access the account.
<li>Download and install Git for your operating system: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
</ul>
